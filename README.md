# Swiss Tour Application (Backend)

## Goal

This app was created for the Swiss Disc Golf Association (SDA) in order to solve the following problems:
- Automate the calculation of Swiss Tour standings
- Implement a web-based GUI for administrator access, easily usable by non-tech-savvy users to add players, events and results
- Track Swiss player statistics for selection for national teams
- Integrate additional tools for tournament directors (i.e. checking which players have valid swiss tour licenses)  

## Features
- REST API for events, players, and tournaments
- Scrapping of event results from pdga.com
- Calculation of standings
  
## Design
 

## Development

The backend (this repository) is written using Spring Boot and was initially kick-started using Bootify.io.
